## Credits

I want to give credit to some plugins that helped me while developing **PlayerScope**

- **[RetainerTrack](https://git.carvel.li/liza/RetainerTrack)** - [(repo)](https://plugins.carvel.li/) by liza: I built PlayerScope directly on top of RetainerTrack. Its structure and features made it much easier to implement the functionality I needed. Without it, it would have been impossible for me to create this plugin.
- **[PlayerTrack](https://github.com/kalilistic/PlayerTrack)** by kalilistic: I used this as a reference and integrated its features into my plugin.
